== Description ==

Virtual Real Estate Agent is a plugin to display your chatbot on the frontend at the bottom left and/or bottom right by just entering the URL in the admin settings.

For instance, if you have a standalone chatbot which you would like to display on your Wordpress website as well, then you just need to enter the URL of your chatbot in the plugin settings, and your chatbot will be served inside the `iframe` and it will appear right away on the frontend of your WordPress website.

* Click on Virtual Real Estate Agent located in the sidebar and then click on Settings.
* Enable the chat plugin by clicking on the checkbox “Enable”
* Fill the URL text field, with the link of your website. For example, we will use the Karola chatbot link.
* Select the position of where the chatbot icon should be displayed and click on “Save Changes”. In our case, we will choose “Bottom Right” for our Karola chatbot.
* Navigate to your WordPress dashboard link.
* On the bottom right corner, click on the chatbot icon to display the chatbot.
